We’ll chat things through, to make sure I understand exactly what you want, and what your child needs. I will carefully assess your child’s strengths, and also identify areas where they need support and extension. Then I create a tailored teaching programme for your child and will review this with you, and answer any questions you may have.

As your child learns and develops, I adjust and reshape the programme to ensure they continue to progress.
