For children preparing for Key Stage 2 SATs, I can provide the next Step Up to ensure they are comfortable and ready. I have access to past papers and can:

* assess your child’s strengths and weaknesses in relation to the tests and use this information to target the support I give;
* take your child through reading and maths questions;
* sharpen up their writing style across the full range of text types;
* give guidance on test technique;
* prepare pupils for the Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation Test.


Where appropriate, I’ll give additional material for your child to work on in their own time at home.
