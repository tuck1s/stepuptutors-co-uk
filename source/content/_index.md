# Why Step Up Tutors?

Some children find it difficult to concentrate in a busy classroom, and can really benefit from going over the topics with calm, patient, individual support.

Step Up Tutors:
* Is tailored to your child’s individual needs
* Builds confidence, introducing new ideas at the right time for your child
* Provides one-to-one sessions with an experienced teacher
* ... and it’s fun!

Others want to develop and extend their gifts beyond what’s available in school. **Step Up** can provide for this too.

## COVID update: remote sessions via Zoom

I have specialist educational software that works well over Zoom, to provide interactive remote learning that is both rigorous and fun. As well as providing child-centered benefits, this also reduces the amount of taxiing around for parents!
