# Why Step Up?

* Tailored to your child’s individual needs
* Builds confidence, introducing new ideas at the right time for your child
* One-to-one support from an experienced teacher
* .. and it’s fun!

Some children find it difficult to concentrate in a busy classroom, and can really benefit from going over the topics with calm, patient, individual support.

Others want to develop and extend their gifts beyond what’s available in school. StepUp can provide for this too.
